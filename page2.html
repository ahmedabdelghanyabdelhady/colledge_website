            More than a million people worldwide are known to have died after testing positive for the coronavirus.
            <br><br>
            While early research suggests the infection is mild in four out of five cases, a subset of patients endure life-threatening complications.
            <br><br>
            Everything from pneumonia and punctured lungs to cardiac arrests and sepsis has been reported among critically-ill COVID patients.
            <br><br>
            No vaccine and limited treatment options mean wearing face coverings, maintaining social distancing and regular hand washing remains our best defence.
            <br><br>
            With the coronavirus unheard of this time last year, many are wondering what makes the infection so dangerous for some.
            <br><br>
            Among those who notice their symptoms, some research implies patients are at their most infectious before they feel ill.
