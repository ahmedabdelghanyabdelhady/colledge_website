    <h1><u>6 Ways to Cope With COVID-19</u></h1>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Strategy #1: Assess the Four Pillars</b></li>
        <p>Ensuring we have a rock-solid foundation for basic health needs is a must. These four pillars are the foundation for emotion regulation, and they are like the legs of a table. If the emotion-regulation table is unstable, then it is difficult to use other coping methods and build ourselves up. The four pillars consist of sleep hygiene, nutrition, staying physically active, and social support. Let us begin by simply reflecting on our emotion-regulation table’s stability.</p>
        <li><b>Strategy #2: Emotion-Based Coping</b></li>
        <p>Here is the good news about emotions: Emotions are momentary. Emotions can rise up to be tidal waves, but they will pass. Emotion-based coping strategies help you stay upright through the emotional waves by matching your actions to your feelings.</p>
        <li><b>Strategy #3: Grounding</b></li>
        <p>When we have intense emotional pain or overwhelming anxiety, grounding helps anchor us to the reality that is occurring in the present moment. In short, grounding provides distance between us and our negative feelings. Grounding can be broken down into mental, physical, and soothing strategies (Najavits, 2002).</p>
        <li><b>Strategy #4: Deep Breathing</b></li>
        <p>Deep breathing, also called diaphragmatic breathing, is a sure-fire method of managing your body’s response to anxiety and stress. Anxiety and stress attack your nervous system and send you into a “fight, flight, or freeze” response that wears down your body with a multitude of physical symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath, racing heart, trembling, dizziness, sweating).</p>
        <li><b>Strategy #5: Mindfulness</b></li>
        <p>Mindfulness boosts our immune system, increases positive emotions while reducing stress, and facilitates healthy relationships in couples and families. Mindfulness is a mental superpower of being mentally active, accepting, and open to the moment to moment process. In short, we tune in to what we are sensing, feeling, and thinking as it occurs in the present moment without giving it any judgments of “good” or “bad.”</p>
        <li><b>Strategy #6: Altruism</b></li>
        <p>A plethora of research has consistently supported the notion that focusing efforts to help other people helps cultivate better emotional health. Given the COVID-19 precautions that limit contact, helping may look a little different, like calling to check in on a friend, sending encouraging texts, or sending uplifting videos to others.</p>
